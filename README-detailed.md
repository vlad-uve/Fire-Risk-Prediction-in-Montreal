### 2.2 🔧 Processing Workflow
We followed a structured, **five-step workflow**, to ensure that all datasets were clean, consistent, and ready for integration into the predictive modeling:

<p align="center">
  <img src="files/images/data_workflow_chart.png" alt="Processing Workflow" width="800"/>
</p


1️⃣ **Attribute Analysis**: Analyzed dataset columns to select relevant and useful features for modeling.

2️⃣ **Removal of Irrelevant Entries**: Filtered out redundant and unnecessary records to reduce noise.  

3️⃣ **Correction of Structural Errors**: Corrected formatting and alignment issues.

4️⃣ **Outlier Filtering and Missing Data Handling**: Removed extreme values and filled gaps for consistency.

5️⃣ **Data Verification and Preparation**: Final check to ensure data was clean, complete, and ready for modeling.


### 2.3 🔍 Insights and Trends Identified

#### 🔥 Fire Incidents:  
  - Non-residential fires peaked on weekends and in summer, with a decline in recent years.  
  - Residential fires showed a consistent pattern, slightly increased in recent years and also peaked on weekends.  

#### 🏠 Property Assessments:    
  - Key features identified for modeling include max floors, year built, land area, building area.

#### 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Data:  
  - Certain crime types like vehicle theft were excluded due to weak correlation.  
  - Retained categories like "Break into property" and "Mischief" linked to higher fire risk.  

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑Census Data:  
  - Variables such as population density, family size, income levels, and dwelling values potentially influence fire risks.  
  - High-density areas may raise fire risk (e.g., electrical load).
  - Income levels and dwelling values suggest differences in preventive measures.


## 3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering

### 3.1 🗺️ Data Aggregation
To enable consistent spatial analysis, Montreal was divided into 685 grid cells, each 1 km², with unique identifiers for integration across datasets.

<p align="center">
  <img src="files/images/montreal_grid_map.png" alt="Actual Fire Risk" width="400"/>
</p>

#### For each grid cell, we aggregated key temporal data sources:

- 🔥 **Monthly Fire incidents** — Total incidents per cell for each month
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Monthly Crime counts** — Aggregated by type and frequency for each month

#### For each grid cell, we aggregated key constant data attributes:
- 🏠 **Building attributes** — Averaged building characteristics (e.g., construction year, floors)  
- 👥 **Census metrics** — Averaged population characteristics (e.g., density, income levels, dwelling types)


### 3.2 🎯Target Class
We defined a **high-risk area** as any grid cell with **2 or more fire incidents in a month**, averaging about 76 high-risk areas citywide per month. This equates to approximately one high-risk grid per fire station per month (68 stations).

- 🔻 **Threshold = 1 fire** would result in ~140 high-risk areas per month
- 🔺 **Threshold = 3 fires** would reduce it to ~30 areas.
- 🎯 The threshold of 2 fires or more was deemed most appropriate for actionable insights.


## 4. 🤖 Model Approach

### 4.1 Objective and Workflow
The modeling approach focused on effectively **predicting high-risk fire areas** through **binary classification**, addressing data challenges and optimizing model performance. 

#### Overall workflow:
- **1️⃣ Establish Baseline Models**: Start with simple models to set performance benchmarks (Dummy Classifier, Decision Tree)
- **2️⃣ Develop and Evaluate Advanced Models**: Build and test more sophisticated models to identify the most promising approach.  
- **3️⃣ Optimize Model Performance**: Enhance the selected model through iterative improvements

### 4.2 🧮 Evaluation Strategy and Metric
Effective prediction means identifying both high-risk and low-risk areas while minimizing misclassifications. Image below indicates consequences of correct and incorrect classification of each class.

- **❗False Negatives:** High-risk areas misclassified as low-risk = risk of delayed response, greater damage, and higher costs

- ⚠️ **False positives:** Low-risk areas misclassified as high-risk = wasted inspections, inefficient use of staff

<p align="center">
  <img src="files/images/confusion_matrix_explanation.png" alt="Actual Fire Risk" width="400"/>
</p>


#### We selected:

- **F1-score** as the primary metric to compare different models, addressing the challenge of evaluating classifiers on an imbalanced dataset.

  > This metric **balances precision (avoiding false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives)**, making it well-suited for the highly imbalanced dataset.

- **High-risk recall** as the key metric during model improvement, given that the high-risk class is smaller but critical to identify accurately.

  > A higher high-risk recall **reduces false negatives**, ensuring the model correctly flags most high-risk areas, which allows proactive intervention and minimizes missed incidents.

- **High-risk precision** as a supporting metric to limit misclassified low-risk areas.

  > A higher high-risk precision **reduces false positives**, that ensures truly predicted high-risk zones and that inspection resources are used efficiently by minimizing unnecessary inspections in low-risk areas


### 4.3 🗂️ Data splitting
**To preserve temporal integrity**, we used a time-based train/test split:

- **Training set: Jan 2011 – Dec 2022**  
- **Test set: Jan 2023 – Dec 2023**

<p align="center">
  <img src="files/images/dataset_split.png" alt="Actual Fire Risk" width="600"/>
</p>



## 5. 🏗️Model Development

### 5.1 🧪 Initial Model Comparison
The evaluation of initial models highlighted the performance gap between **simple Decision Tree and Dummy Classifier**, and **advanced methods**, as shown in the accompanying performance metrics:

- **Dummy Classifier** - Baseline F1-score of **0.47**, reflecting its limited predictive capability.  
- **Decision Tree Classifier** - Marginally improved performance with an F1-score of **0.55**.  
- **XGBoost** - Achieved a notable F1-score of **0.63** using basic settings, demonstrating potential  
- **LightGBM** - Delivered comparable performance to XGBoost, with an F1-score of **0.62**.  

>The visualized metrics **underscore XGBoost’s ability to outperform simpler models**, justifying its selection for further optimization to address the fire-risk prediction challenge.

</p>


### 5.2 🔧 Handling Class Imbalance & XGBoost Tuning

The main challenge affecting the model's predictive accuracy was **significant class imbalance** (~100,000 low-risk vs. ~13,000 high-risk samples). To mitigate this imbalance, **SMOTE** and **Oversampling** balancing techniques were applied to increase the representation of the high-risk class.

#### **🎯 Effect on High-Risk Class Metrics**
- **SMOTE** — modestly improved high-risk recall to **51%**.  
- **Random Oversampling** — significantly improved high-risk recall to **81%**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="files/images/high_class_metrics_chart.png" alt="High-Risk Class Metrics" width="400"/>
</p>


#### **⚖️ Effect on Weighted Metrics**
- Class balancing techniques do not see almost any influence on weighted metrics.

<p align="center">
  <img src="files/images/weighted_metrics_chart.png" alt="Weighted Metrics" width="400"/>
</p>


>Based on these results, we selected **XGBoost with Random Oversampling** as the final modeling technique, since it **returns highest recall on the target high-risk class**.
